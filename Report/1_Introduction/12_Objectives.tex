\section{Objectives}

It will be crated a system called Ticketchain to have a place where organizers can manage their events. We would allow only for approved organizers to create their events, to avoid spam from random entities. Every time an organizer creates an event, we guarantee that we can't interfere with any event operation. We'll be having a website to ease the managing their events.

There will also be an app for the users to check the events and manage their tickets. The events shown are gonna be the ones stored in our Ticketchain system. They will also have access to the marketplace, where they will be able to resell their tickets for a price no higher than the original one.

For the validators, we will have yet another app that allows them to validate user tickets at the entrance of the venue. These validators are selected by the organizer on the event smart contract, and their job is to truthfully verify the tickets, without any chance of fraud. These validators can be either a person with their app to operate or even some automated machine, like a turnstile.
