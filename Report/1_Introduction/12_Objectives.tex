\section{Objectives}

We will have a website that will allow Ticketchain to approve organizers into our system to be able create events, so that no random entity can create freely, which would lead to spam. This would also be for the event organizers themselves where, if allowed, they would be able to manage their events, and manage admins and validators associated to them.

There will also be an app for the users to check the events and manage their tickets. The events shown are gonna be the ones stored in our Ticketchain system. They will also have access to the marketplace, where they will be able to resell their tickets for a price no higher than the original one.

For the validators, we will have yet another app that allows them to validate user tickets at the entrance of the venue. These validators are selected by the organizer for the event, and their job is to truthfully verify the tickets, without any chance of fraud. These validators can be either a person with their app to operate or even some automated machine, like a turnstile.
