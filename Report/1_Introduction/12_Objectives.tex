\section{Objectives}

It will be crated a Ticketchain smart contract to have a place to manage organizers and their events. We could allow for anyone to create an event on this platform, but that would cause a lot of spam. This way, we have to allow the organizer to our system, and then they can create their events. For each event, there is its own smart contract that is deployed, transfering its ownership to the event organizer, so that Ticketchain can't interfere with any operation. We'll be having a website to ease the access to that smart contract and to allow for the organizer to manage their events.

Then, there will be an app for the users to check the events and manage their tickets. The events shown are gonna be the ones stored in our Ticketchain smart contract. They will aslo have access to the marketplace, where they will be able to resell their tickets for a price no higher than the original one.

For the validators, we will have another app that allows them to validate user tickets at the entrance of the venue. These validators are selected by the organizer on the event smart contract, and their job is to truthfully verify the tickets, without any chance of fraud. These validators can be either a person with their app to operate or even a turnstile.
