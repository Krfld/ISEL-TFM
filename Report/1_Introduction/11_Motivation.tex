\section{Motivation}

The motivation for this work is primarily to avoid ticket scalping. This is the process of buying tickets in bulk, exploiting high demand, and reselling them at significantly inflated prices. This not only disadvantages people that genuinely want to attend but also undermines the integrity of the ticketing system. Traditional ticketing platforms often rely on centralized databases and intermediaries, providing opportunities for scalpers to manipulate the system and engage in fraudulent activities. By using blockchain, its possible to create a system that prevents any kind of unwanted operations, because of the properties of smart contracts, that enforce a certain behavior, allowing for users to resell a ticket, but not for a price higher than the original price. This is a way to guarantee that the end user will have a fair and transparent ticketing process.
