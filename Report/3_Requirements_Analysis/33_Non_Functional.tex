\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non_functional_requirements}

The non-functional requirements are the features that the system must have to fulfill the user's needs, but that are not directly related to the system's functionality.

The system must have the following non-functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalable}: The system must be able to handle a large number of users and events.
    \item \textbf{Low fees}: The system must have low fees for any kind of operation.
    \item \textbf{Fast}: The system must be fast to allow events to have the smoothest experience possible.
    \item \textbf{Secure}: The system must be secure to avoid any kind of fraud.
    \item \textbf{User-friendly}: The system must be user-friendly to allow users to easily buy and sell tickets.
\end{itemize}

The scalable, low fees and fast requirements are essencially associated with the blockchain network choice. As we saw in the Subsection \ref{subsec:networks}, different networks have different characteristics and we need to choose the one that best fits our needs.
The secure and user-friendly requirements are associated with the system's design and implementation. We need to design the system in a way that is secure, to avoid any kind of fraud, and have a smooth experience for the users.
