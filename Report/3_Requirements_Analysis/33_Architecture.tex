\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

In this Section we will be mentioning the architecture of the system. As we can
see in the Figure \ref{fig:architecture}, the main system will store the
organizers that are allowed to create events. For each event created by them,
there will be ticket packages deployed, which contains the batch of tickets for
each, and the users will buy them and, consequently, the validators can
validate them at the entrance of the venue. The validators are assigned to
operate in each event and one validator can be assigned to multiple ones.
