[brief introduction of the section]


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{subsec:functional_requirements}

The functional requirements are the features that the system must have to fulfill the users needs.

~

The system must have the following functional requirements:

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Functional Requirements}
    \label{tab:functional_requirements}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Requirement}             & \textbf{Description}                                                                                                                                 \\
        \hline
        Connect to a wallet software     & The system must be able to connect to a wallet software to interact with the blockchain and to allow the validation of the ownership of the tickets. \\
        \hline
        Interact with the smart contract & The system has to interact with the smart contract to display the necessary information and to update the state of any event or ticket.              \\
        \hline
        Add nfts metadata to IPFS        & The system must be able to add the nfts metadata to IPFS to allow the users to see the information about the tickets.                                \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{subsec:non_functional_requirements}

The non-functional requirements are the features that the system must have to fulfill the users needs, but that are not directly related to the systems functionality.

~

The system must have the following non-functional requirements:

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Non-Functional Requirements}
    \label{tab:non_functional_requirements}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Description}                                                               \\
        \hline
        Scalable             & The system must be able to handle a large number of users and events.              \\
        \hline
        Low fees             & The system must have low fees for any kind of operation.                           \\
        \hline
        Fast                 & The system must be fast to allow events to have the smoothest experience possible. \\
        \hline
        Secure               & The system must be secure to avoid any kind of fraud.                              \\
        \hline
        User-friendly        & The system must be user-friendly to allow users to easily buy and sell tickets.    \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The scalable, low fees and fast requirements are essencially associated with the blockchain network choice. As we saw in the Subsection \ref{subsec:networks}, different networks have different characteristics and we need to choose the one that best fits our needs.
The secure and user-friendly requirements are associated with the systems design and implementation. We need to design the system in a way that is secure, to avoid any kind of fraud, and have a smooth experience for the users.
