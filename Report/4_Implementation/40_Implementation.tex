\chapter{Implementation}
 [Brief introduction of the chapter]

% Being a blockchain project, the goal is to not use the so called Web2 technologies, this means the traditional approaches of having a backend running on a server and similar services, but rather to use only Web3 technologies for us to understand exactly the limitations there are by adopting solely the blockchain ecosystem. Ideally, of course, in the future this project benefits greatly by merging these two approaches.
