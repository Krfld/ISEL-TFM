\chapter*{Abstract}

% This project explores the design, development, and implementation of a blockchain-based ticketing system aimed at revolutionizing the ticketing industry by addressing the pervasive issue of ticket scalping. The proposed system leverages the inherent transparency, immutability, and decentralized nature of blockchain technology to create a secure and trustful environment for buying, selling and refunding event tickets.

The traditional ticketing industry faces challenges such as ticket scalping, fraud, and limited transparency in secondary markets. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize ticketing by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient solution. This thesis proposes a blockchain-based ticketing system that leverages the core strengths of blockchain technology to address these shortcomings.

The system utilizes smart contracts to manage the ticket lifecycle securely, from creation by event organizers to purchase and transfer by users. This ensures authenticity and eliminates the risk of counterfeiting. Additionally, the system facilitates a secure and transparent secondary market for ticket resale, with fair pricing mechanisms and clear ownership tracking.

% The chosen blockchain platform, along with relevant security measures, will be discussed to ensure the system's robustness and user privacy. Integration with existing ticketing platforms and access control systems might also be explored to enhance user experience and system adoption.
