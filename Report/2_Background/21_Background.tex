Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for the creation of a decentralized network of nodes that can reach consensus on the state of the network without the need for a central authority. It is a peer-to-peer network where each node has a copy of the ledger and can validate transactions. The ledger is a chain of blocks that contain transactions. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, a timestamp and a nonce. The hash of a block is calculated using the hash of the previous block, the timestamp and the nonce. The nonce is a random number that is used to change the hash of the block. This is done to make it harder to find a valid hash. The hash of a block is used to validate the block. If the hash of a block is valid, the block is added to the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the block is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded. The hash of a block is also used to validate the chain. If the hash of a block is not valid, the chain is discarded.
