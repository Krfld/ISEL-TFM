\subsection{Application of NFTs}
\label{subsec:application_of_nfts}

NFTs have seen widespread adoption in industries like art and gaming, where they are used to represent ownership of unique digital assets. In the art industry, NFTs are employed to create and sell digital artworks, which are authenticated on the blockchain to ensure uniqueness. These digital pieces can be traded or sold, with creators often benefiting from resale royalties. 

In the gaming industry, NFTs are used to represent unique in-game items, such as skins, weapons, or characters, that can be bought, sold, and traded between players. These items can enhance gameplay or serve as collectibles. One of the most famous NFT projects is the \href{https://www.boredapeyachtclub.com/}{Bored Ape Yacht Club}, which features a collection of digital apes (in JPEG format) that have sold for millions of dollars. Beyond just being digital art, ownership of these NFTs grants access to exclusive events, merchandise, and a vibrant community of collectors.
