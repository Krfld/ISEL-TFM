They also have a wide range of physical outlets, like \emph{Worten}, \emph{Fnac}, and \emph{El Corte Ingl√©s}, making it convenient to buy tickets in person.

They have a website where they list all the events organizers are selling tickets for. The user can then open the event they are interested in and check all the details about it and it allows for the user to buy the tickets online and print them at home, or directs them to a physical outlet where they can buy them in person.
