\section{Frontend}
For any kind of project there's always a frontend part to allow the user to interact with the system. In this project, the goal is to build a mobile app for the common users to manage their tickets, allowing them to buy, sell, trade and refund them, as well as a way to validate them when entering the event.
There will also be a version of the mobile app for the organizers, where they have the power to authenticate each user at the entrance of the venue. These are called validators.
Another part of the frontend is the admin panel, where the organizers can manage the events. This makes more sense to be done as a website, since it's easier to manage and it's not something that anyone will need to access on the go.
